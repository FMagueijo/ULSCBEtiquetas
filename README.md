# ULSCBEtiquetas
A Python made during my 3 months Internship at Catelo Branco Hospital (ULSCB), this App is used to get and print (zebra printer) a patient's information in a small tag (5x3).
This was my first ever app project using the Tkinter Library (TkinterBootstrap), I also had to learn to draw tags in ZPL.
Overall, even though it was a project that didn't took long to make, it was still really fun and taught me alot of things I didn't know how to use.
