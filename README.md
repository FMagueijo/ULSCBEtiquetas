# ULSCBEtiquetas
A Python Application made during my 3 months Internship at Castelo Branco Hospital (ULSCB), this App is used to get and print (to a zebra printer) a patient's information in a small tag (5x3cm).
This was my first ever project using the Tkinter Library (TkinterBootstrap), I also had to learn how to draw tags in ZPL.
Overall, even though it was a project that didn't took long to make, it was still really fun and taught me alot of things I didn't know how to use.

(Includes .exe files)
(may contain some UI bugs, but nothing major)
